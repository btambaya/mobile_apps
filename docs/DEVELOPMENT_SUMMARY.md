## Architecture Decisions

### Why Flutter?
- Single codebase for iOS, Android, and Web
- Fast development with hot reload
- Rich widget library for complex financial UIs
- Strong typing with Dart prevents runtime errors

### Why go_router over Navigator 2.0?
- Declarative routing is easier to maintain
- Built-in deep linking support
- ShellRoute for persistent bottom navigation
- Type-safe route parameters

### Why flutter_bloc?
- Separation of business logic from UI
- Predictable state management
- Easy to test
- Good DevTools integration

### Why Finnhub for supplementary data?
- Free tier with 60 requests/minute
- Has analyst ratings, price targets, news
- DriveWealth doesn't provide these endpoints
- Simple REST API, no complex auth

### KYC Flow Design
```
5-Step KYC Flow:
1. Personal Info (name, address, tax ID)
2. Investor Profile (employment, income, experience)
3. Document Upload (ID verification)
4. Disclosures (agreement checkboxes)
5. Pending (verification status)
```

Rationale: Breaking into steps prevents form fatigue while collecting all DriveWealth-required data.

GET /accounts/{id}    # Get account details
```

3. **Orders API** - Execute trades
```
POST /orders          # Place order
GET /orders/{id}      # Get order status
DELETE /orders/{id}   # Cancel order
```

4. **Funding API** - Deposits/withdrawals
```
POST /funding/deposits      # Create deposit
POST /funding/withdrawals   # Create withdrawal
```

**Authentication:** Bearer token in header
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Finnhub Integration (Models Created)

**Base URL:** `https://finnhub.io/api/v1`  
**API Key Location:** `lib/features/trading/data/datasources/finnhub_remote_datasource.dart` line 7

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Replace `YOUR_FINNHUB_API_KEY` before production!

**How to Get API Key:**
1. Go to https://finnhub.io/register
2. Create free account
3. Copy API key from dashboard
4. Update `finnhub_remote_datasource.dart`

**Rate Limits:** 60 requests/minute on free tier

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ `flutter_secure_storage` for encrypted storage
- ✅ Biometric auth UI (ready, not connected)
- ✅ Input validation on forms
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs

### Before Production - MUST DO

1. **Move API Keys to Environment**
```dart
// Instead of:
final _apiKey = 'YOUR_FINNHUB_API_KEY';

// Use:
final _apiKey = const String.fromEnvironment('FINNHUB_API_KEY');
```

2. **Implement SSL Pinning**
```dart
// For DriveWealth and Finnhub connections
// Use package like http_certificate_pinning
```

3. **Backend Input Validation**
- Never trust client-side validation alone
- Validate all inputs on Lambda functions

4. **AWS Security**
- Use Cognito for JWT token validation
- Implement API Gateway rate limiting
- Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager

### Sensitive Data Handling
- BVN, SSN, TIN - encrypted in secure storage
- Never log PII
- W-8BEN data stored only on DriveWealth

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Issues (Non-blocking)

| Issue | Location | Impact | Priority |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| Deprecated `value` on DropdownButtonFormField | Multiple KYC pages | None (works) | Low |
| Deprecated `activeColor` on Switch | settings_page, security_page | None (works) | Low |
| Test file import error | test/widget_test.dart | Tests don't run | Medium |
| WASM warnings | flutter_secure_storage_web | Web build still works | Low |

### Technical Debt

1. **Mock Data Everywhere**
   - All screens use mock data
   - Need to replace with real API calls
   - Pattern: Create repositories + BLoC for each feature

2. **No Error Handling UI**
   - Need loading states, error states, empty states
   - Create reusable error widget

3. **No Offline Support**
   - Consider caching stock data
   - Handle network errors gracefully

4. **No Unit Tests**
   - Add tests for models, repositories, BLoCs
   - Add widget tests for key flows

5. **No Analytics**
   - Add Firebase Analytics or Mixpanel
   - Track key user journeys

## How to Continue Development

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Apply for DriveWealth Access**
   - Visit https://www.drivewealth.com/partners
   - Apply for sandbox/partner access
   - Get API credentials

2. **Set Up AWS Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CDK (recommended)
   cd infrastructure/
   npm install
   cdk deploy --all
   ```
   
   Required AWS services:
   - Cognito User Pool (authentication)
   - API Gateway (REST endpoints)
   - Lambda (Python functions)
   - DynamoDB (user data)
   - Secrets Manager (API keys)

3. **Connect Authentication**
   - Replace mock auth in login_page.dart with Cognito
   - Store JWT in secure storage
   - Implement token refresh

4. **Implement BLoC Pattern**
   ```
   For each feature, create:
   lib/features/{feature}/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── repositories/
   │   │   └── {feature}_repository.dart
   │   └── datasources/
   │       └── {feature}_remote_datasource.dart
   ├── domain/
   │   ├── entities/
   │   └── usecases/
   └── presentation/
       ├── bloc/
       │   ├── {feature}_bloc.dart
       │   ├── {feature}_event.dart
       │   └── {feature}_state.dart
       ├── pages/
       └── widgets/
   ```

### Feature Priority Order

1. Authentication (Cognito)
2. KYC Flow (DriveWealth Users API)
3. Portfolio (DriveWealth Accounts API)
4. Trading (DriveWealth Orders API)
5. Wallet (Paystack + DriveWealth Funding)
6. Market Data (Finnhub integration)

## Running & Testing

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.x installed
- Xcode (for iOS)
- Android Studio (for Android)
- Chrome (for web)

### Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/Desktop/stock_company/mobile_app

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Chrome (web)
flutter run -d chrome

# Run on iOS simulator
open -a Simulator
flutter run -d ios

# Run on Android emulator
flutter run -d android

# Build for production
flutter build web
flutter build ios --release
flutter build apk --release

# Run tests (once fixed)
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze
```

### Navigating the App

```
Splash (/) → Onboarding → Login → Verify OTP → KYC Flow → Home

From Home:
├── Portfolio tab → Holdings list
├── Trade tab → Search stocks → Stock Detail
├── Wallet tab → Deposit/Withdraw
└── Profile tab → Settings, Documents, etc.
```
